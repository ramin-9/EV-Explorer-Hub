         <h2> Introduction</h2>
         <pre> This Report will explain the elements of a good design. It also will provide some reasons that department should consider in this design.    </pre>
         <h2> Disscussion</h2>
       
      
         <pre id="report"> To have a good design, I consider some elements that help the design conforms to web and accessibility standards. <br>
          Balance, contrast, emphasis, proportion, repetition and unity<a class="fnref" id="footnote1_ref" href="#footnote-1"></a> are elements that causes the design look good.
          In my web design, I tried to use them till it was possible. 
          First, my design Provides sufficient contrast between foreground and background. It means the background doesn't overlap the foreground message
           And users can observe the sentences at ease. Next, it Provides clear and consistent navigation options. On the welcoming page, I created a navigation bar
           encompassing three sections, allowing users to access other pages quickly. Unity is another strength of my design. I used the same typography font, size and colour on all the pages
           because users can immediately find inconsistencies in the design. Variety in design will create visual interest. Using colour, typography, images, and shapes 
           makes my design not become monotonous. White space in the pages is enough, and users don't feel confused. The website is about electric vehicle
           I tried to utilise the green colour in my design. Repetition of green colour exists in the navigation bar and background image on the About us page.
          Moreover, it creates designs for different viewport sizes, which are suitable for all users because of its features. 
          It is easy to learn the differences. The structure is the same as other websites. It has few errors, so it is efficient. Response time is quick, and users 
          don't need to wait more than 10 seconds. It doesn't define the text size using absolute units. It checks colour choices on accessibility sites.
          It never tiles the image under the text. Texts and pictures usually do not overlap in my design. It does not exceed more than three sequential Acceleration
          because it is difficult for users to remember. White space, padding and margin make my design user-friendly and easy to read.
          I break up the text using lines and borders and keep paragraphs short and concise. As I mentioned before, Consistency is critical in my design.
          Each page has the same navigation bar and font, and colour. Finally, I use media queries for responsive design in small devices and print.
           <a class="fnref" id="footnote2_ref" href="#footnote-2"></a>
        </pre>
        <h2> Conclusion</h2>
        <pre> My design provides sufficient contrast between foreground and background, and clear and consistent navigation options. I used the same typography font, 
         size and colour on all the pages because users can immediately find inconsistencies in the design. Using colour, typography, images, and shapes makes my design not become monotonous.
          Design is easy to read and easy to understand. Response time is quick and users don't need to wait more than 10 seconds for a page to load. 
          Each page has the same navigation bar and font, and colour, and media queries for responsive design in small devices and print.</pre>
